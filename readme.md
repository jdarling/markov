Markov Chain
---

This is just a playground project for me where I'm building a full Markov Chain
implementation from the ground up.  There are already Markov Chain components on
NPM, many better than what I will likely develop here.  I just wanted something
to learn from.

Feel free to clone/fork/modify to your hearts content.
